## My task

My task for this homework was to create a Note taker. 

The user should be able to see existing notes and add new notes to the app. 

The note shows the title, the body and if the user clicks on the save button it adds it to the existing notes. 

In this homework my task was to create the server part of the app to make it work and bring all the docs together so the app runs. I also had to deploy it on Heroku.
